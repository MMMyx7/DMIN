# Dominant Modality Interaction Network for Multimodal Intent Recognition via Hierarchical Semantic Fusion

This repository provides the official PyTorch implementation of the research paper:

 [Dominant Modality Interaction Network for Multimodal Intent Recognition via Hierarchical Semantic Fusion]

## 1. Introduction

Multimodal intent recognition (MIR) aims to leverage various modalities, such as textual, visual, and acoustic data, to accurately identify user intent, which plays a crucial role in understanding human behavior in real-world multimodal scenarios.

## 2. Dependencies 

We use anaconda to create python environment:

```
conda create --name python=3.6
```

Install all required libraries:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
